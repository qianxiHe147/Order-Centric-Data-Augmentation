This is important because it indicates that James is indeed going to the cinema for some purpose. However, we need to consider the implications of this in relation to the other premises.\n\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of watching TV series\nPremise 3 states that customers who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas. Since James watches TV series in cinemas, it implies that he does not prefer TV series. This is a contradiction because if he is watching TV series in cinemas, he must not be a customer who prefers TV series.\n\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that James goes to cinemas every week. While we have established that James watches TV series in cinemas, we do not have any direct evidence from the premises that confirms he goes to cinemas every week. Premise 2 states that some customers go to cinemas every week, but it does not specify that James is one of them.\n\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"James goes to cinemas every week\" is Unknown. While we know he watches TV series in cinemas, we cannot definitively conclude that he goes to cinemas every week based on the provided premises."

According to premise 2, if someone is born in Israel to at least one Israeli parent, they receive Israeli citizenship at birth. Therefore, David Ha'ivri is an Israeli citizen.\n\n\nStep 2: Analyze David Ha'ivri's emigration to the United States.\nPremise 3 also states that David Ha'ivri emigrated to the United States from Israel. While this indicates that he now resides in the United States, it does not provide direct evidence that he has acquired U.S. citizenship. Emigration does not automatically confer citizenship.\n\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion about U.S. citizenship.\nThe conclusion states that David Ha'ivri is a United States citizen (American(davidHaivri)). However, based on the premises, we only know that he is an Israeli citizen due to his birth circumstances. There is no information provided that confirms whether he has taken the necessary steps to become a U.S. citizen after emigrating.\n\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"David Ha'ivri is a United States citizen\" is Unknown because we do not have enough information to determine whether he has acquired U.S. citizenship after emigrating."

This means that all iPhones are excluded from being standalone desktops.\n\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the relationship between Apple-made cellphones and iPhones\nFrom premise 2, we see that all Apple-made cellphones are classified as iPhones. Therefore, any Apple-made cellphone also cannot be a standalone desktop due to premise 1.\n\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the A15 Bionic chips and their implications\nFrom premise 3, we know that any phone with A15 Bionic chips is an Apple-made cellphone. Thus, it is also an iPhone and cannot be a standalone desktop.\n\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the four core-GPU phones\nFrom premise 4, we see that any phone equipped with a four core-GPU made by Apple is also a phone with A15 Bionic chips. Therefore, it follows the same logic as in Step 3, meaning it cannot be a standalone desktop.\n\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the unannounced Huawei phone\nPremise 5 states that if the unannounced Huawei phone is either a phone with A15 Bionic chips or equipped with a four core-GPU made by Apple, then it cannot be both a phone with A15 Bionic chips and a standalone desktop. \n\nThis means that if the unannounced Huawei phone is either of those, it must be excluded from being a standalone desktop.\n\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that Joe is not a PhD student, which is represented in FOL as ¬(Phone(unannouncedHuaweiPhone) ∧ EquippedWith(unannouncedHuaweiPhone, fourCoreGPU) ∧ MadeByApple(unannouncedHuaweiPhone)). \n\nHowever, the premises do not provide any information about Joe being a PhD student or not. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises provided, as they are focused on the characteristics of the unannounced Huawei phone and do not mention Joe.\n\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Joe is not a PhD student\" is Unknown based on the premises provided.

This means:\n- Customer(lily)\n- In(lily, jameSFamily)\n- WatchIn(lily, tV, cinema)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of watching TV series in cinemas\nFrom premise 4, we have:\n∀x ((Customer(x) ∧ In(x, jameSFamily) ∧ Prefer(x, tVSeries)) → (¬WatchIn(x, tV, cinema)))\nThis means that if a customer in James' family prefers TV series, they will not watch TV series in cinemas. However, since Lily is stated to watch TV series in cinemas, this implies that she does not prefer TV series. Therefore, we can conclude:\n- ¬Prefer(lily, tVSeries)\n\nStep 3: Determine Lily's subscription status\nFrom premise 3, we know that customers in James' family either subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO. Since Lily does not prefer TV series (from Step 2), she could potentially subscribe to AMC A-List. However, we cannot definitively conclude her subscription status based on the given premises.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion about going to cinemas every week\nPremise 2 states that some customers in James' family go to the cinema every week. However, it does not specify whether Lily is one of those customers. Since we have no direct evidence that Lily goes to the cinema every week, we cannot conclude that she does.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Lily goes to cinemas every week\" is Unknown.\n\n### Required:\n- Premise 6 (Lily watches TV series in cinemas)\n- Premise 4 (Implication about preferences and watching behavior)\n- Premise 2 (Some customers go to the cinema every week)"

This can be expressed as:\n- (Have(manny, horseRanch) ∧ LiveIn(manny, crampedBuilding)) ∨ ¬(Have(manny, horseRanch) ⊕ LiveIn(manny, crampedBuilding))\n\nThis means that either:\n- Manny has a horse ranch and lives in a cramped building, or\n- She does not have a horse ranch and does not live in a cramped building.\n\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of owning a horse ranch\nIf Manny has a horse ranch (the first part of the disjunction in premise 6), then according to premise 1, she regularly rides horses for pleasure and sport. However, if she lives in a cramped residential building, this contradicts premise 5, which states that if someone regularly rides horses for pleasure and sport, they do not live in cramped residential buildings. Therefore, if she has a horse ranch, she cannot live in a cramped building.\n\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of not having a horse ranch\nIf Manny does not have a horse ranch (the second part of the disjunction in premise 6), we cannot directly conclude anything about her riding horses for pleasure and sport. We also do not have any information about her disposable income or whether she competes in horse dressage shows.\n\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince we have established that if Manny has a horse ranch, she cannot live in a cramped building, and if she does not have a horse ranch, we have no information about her riding habits. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Manny regularly rides horses for pleasure and sport based on the given premises.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Manny regularly rides horses for pleasure and sport\" is Unknown."
