This means that Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug or she is not a student and is aware that caffeine is a drug. This premise does not directly provide information about Rina's desire to avoid addiction to caffeine.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Premise 5\nPremise 5 states: ¬(IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine) ⊕ Student(rina)). This means that Rina is either a student who is dependent on caffeine or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine. This implies that if Rina is a student, she must be dependent on caffeine, and if she is not a student, she cannot be dependent on caffeine.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of Premise 3\nFrom Premise 3: ¬WantToBeAddictedTo(x, caffeine) → ¬AwareThatDrug(x, caffeine). This means that if someone does not want to be addicted to caffeine, they must be aware that caffeine is a drug. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Combine insights from Premises 4 and 5\nFrom Premise 4, we know that Rina is either a student who is unaware of caffeine being a drug or not a student and aware of it. From Premise 5, if Rina is a student, she must be dependent on caffeine. If she is not a student, she cannot be dependent on caffeine. \n\nIf Rina is a student and unaware of caffeine being a drug, she cannot want to avoid addiction (since she is unaware of the drug's effects). If she is not a student and is aware of caffeine being a drug, she may or may not want to avoid addiction.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premises 4 and 5.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states: ¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∨ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine). \n\nFrom the analysis, if Rina is a student, she is unaware of caffeine being a drug, which satisfies the conclusion. If she is not a student, she is aware of caffeine being a drug, but we cannot definitively conclude whether she wants to avoid addiction or not. However, the structure of the premises allows for the conclusion to hold true in either case.\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug\" is True."

Therefore, the statement that \"no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance\" is contradicted by the existence of Miroslav Venhoda, who is a choral conductor that specializes in Renaissance music.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conclusion's claim\nThe conclusion states that for all choral conductors, they do not specialize in Renaissance music, represented in FOL as:\n∀x (ChoralConductor(x) → ¬SpecializeInPerformanceOf(x, renaissanceMusic))\n\nHowever, since we have established that Miroslav Venhoda is a choral conductor who specializes in Renaissance music, this directly contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion that \"no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance\" is False.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance\" is False."

To be eligible, she must subscribe to AMC A-List. \n\nFrom premise 4, we see that if a customer prefers TV series, they will not watch TV series in cinemas. Since Lily watches TV series in cinemas, it implies that she does not prefer TV series.

Therefore, if Susan is a Yale student, she cannot be a young adult, as it would contradict the premise that all young adults like independence. \n\nThus, if Susan is a Yale student, she cannot be a young adult, which means she cannot be a college student (premise 2 states that all college students are young adults).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 7, Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nNow we have two scenarios:\n1. If Susan is a Harvard student, she is a young adult, but we cannot conclude she is a college student.\n2. If Susan is a Yale student, she cannot be a young adult, and thus cannot be a college student.\n\nSince we have established that if Susan is a Yale student, she cannot be a college student, and if she is a Harvard student, we cannot definitively conclude she is a college student, we cannot determine with certainty whether Susan is a college student or not.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 2, Step 3.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Susan is a college student\" is Uncertain."

If she is not a Nobel physics laureate, then by premise 6, she cannot be an Olympic gold medal winner, which is consistent with our assumption. \n\nHowever, if we assume ¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy), we must also consider the implications of premise 3:\n- If Amy is a full-time scientist, then she does not spend most of her time on sports. \n\nSince premise 1 states that all professional athletes spend most of their time on sports, if Amy spends most of her time on sports, she cannot be a full-time scientist. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6, Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states:\n¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy) → NobelPhysicsLaureate(amy)\n\nIf we assume ¬OlympicGoldMedalWinner(amy), we have established that Amy cannot be a professional athlete (since she spends most of her time on sports) and thus must be a full-time scientist. However, if she is a full-time scientist, she cannot be a Nobel physics laureate (as per premise 4). \n\nThus, the conclusion that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she is a Nobel physics laureate leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate\" is False."

This means that there is no overlap between the set of television stars and the set of certified public accountants.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise\nThe second premise states that for all x, if x is a certified public accountant, then x has good business sense. This means that all members of the set of certified public accountants possess good business sense.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion's claim\nThe conclusion states that for all x, if x is a television star, then x has good business sense. However, from the first premise, we know that television stars cannot be certified public accountants. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that television stars have good business sense based solely on the premises provided.\n\nStep 4: Consider the implications\nSince television stars are not certified public accountants, we have no information about their business sense from the premises. The second premise only applies to certified public accountants, and since television stars do not belong to this group, we cannot conclude anything about their business sense.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"All television stars have good business sense\" is Uncertain because the premises do not provide sufficient information to determine the business sense of television stars."

This means that for ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999, it must have one of these two finishes.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the description of ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999\nFrom premise 5, we know that ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 either has \"rosewood\" in its official description or has a velvet finish. This gives us two possibilities:\n- Case A: RosewoodInDescription(rougeDiorColoredLipBalm999) is true.\n- Case B: VelvetFinish(rougeDiorColoredLipBalm999) is true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of having a satin finish\nIf ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 has a satin finish, then according to premise 3, it cannot have \"rosewood\" in its official description. This means that if it is satin-finish, it must be true that ¬RosewoodInDescription(rougeDiorColoredLipBalm999).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of having \"rosewood\" in the description\nIf ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 has \"rosewood\" in its official description (Case A), then it cannot be a satin finish (as per the conclusion of Step 3). Therefore, if it has \"rosewood,\" it must have a velvet finish.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 3.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nSince we have two cases:\n- If it has \"rosewood,\" it must be a velvet finish.\n- If it does not have \"rosewood,\" it could be a satin finish.\n\nThus, we cannot definitively conclude that ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 has a satin finish because it could also have a velvet finish if it has \"rosewood\" in its description. Therefore, the conclusion remains uncertain.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 has a satin finish.\" is Uncertain."

According to premise 2, if a film is directed by a person, that person is a filmmaker. Since After Tiller is directed by Lana Wilson, we can conclude that:\n- Filmmaker(lanaWilson) is true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Analyze the nature of After Tiller\nPremise 3 states that After Tiller is a documentary, and premise 4 states that a documentary is a type of film. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n- Film(afterTiller) is true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Premise 4.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Analyze the nomination for the award\nPremise 8 states that After Tiller is nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary. However, being nominated does not imply that it has won the award. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lana Wilson has won the award based solely on the nomination.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 8.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince the conclusion states that \"Lana Wilson has won the Independent Spirit Award,\" and we only have evidence that After Tiller was nominated but not that it won, we cannot definitively say that the conclusion is true. Thus, the conclusion remains uncertain.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 3.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Lana Wilson has won the Independent Spirit Award.\" is Uncertain."

This means that any bear that is in a zoo is guaranteed to be not wild. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise\nThe second premise states that there exists at least one bear that is in a zoo. This means there is at least one bear, say bear a, such that Bear(a) ∧ In(a, zoo) holds true. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Combine the information from both premises\nFrom Step 1, we know that if bear a is in the zoo, then ¬Wild(a) must be true (since all bears in zoos are not wild). Therefore, we can conclude that there exists at least one bear (bear a) that is not wild.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that not all bears are wild, which is represented in FOL as ∃x (Bear(x) ∧ ¬Wild(x)).

This directly supports the conclusion that not all bears are wild.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Not all bears are wild\" is True."

However, if she makes her own matcha tea, she cannot prefer to work at home (from the analysis in Step 1). \n\nThus, if she does not prefer to work at home, it follows that she cannot live in California and attend yoga classes regularly, as that would imply she makes her own matcha tea.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Step 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Bunny went to Clay's school and she neither prefers working at home over going to the office nor lives in California and attends yoga classes regularly.\" is True."

According to premise 2, since George can swim, he can control his breath:\n- CanSwim(george) → CanControl(george, breath)\n\nSince George can control his balance, we can also infer from premise 5 that:\n- FunctionalBrainStem(george) → CanControl(george, balance)\n\nThus, since George can control his balance, it implies that he has a functional brainstem:\n- FunctionalBrainStem(george)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 8, Premise 2, Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze George's ability to stand on the ground\nNow that we have established that George has a functional brainstem, we can use this information to analyze whether he can stand on the ground by himself. However, we need to determine if George can walk. \n\nFrom premise 3, we know that all humans can either swim or walk. Since George can swim, he can also walk:\n- CanSwim(george) ∨ CanWalk(george)\n\nSince George can swim, we do not have direct evidence that he can walk, but it does not contradict anything. \n\nStep 3: Analyze George's ability to have functional leg muscles\nFrom premise 4, if George can walk, then he can stand on the ground by himself:\n- CanWalk(george) → CanStandOnTheGround(george, themselves)\n\nFrom premise 6, if George can stand on the ground by himself, then he has functional leg muscles:\n- CanStandOnTheGround(george, themselves) → FunctionalLegMuscle(george)\n\nHowever, we do not have direct evidence that George can walk.

If Jack is a trick-shot artist, he is good at shooting threes (and thus good at shooting 2-pointers and not bad at mid-range shots).\n2. If Jack is good at shooting threes, he is also not bad at mid-range shots.\n\nIn both cases, Jack cannot be bad at mid-range shots. Therefore, the only way for the conclusion to hold true is if Jack is good at shooting threes.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Jack is either a player who successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers or is bad at mid-range shots\" is true because he must be good at shooting threes.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Jack is either a player who successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers or is bad at mid-range shots\" is True."

This gives us two possibilities:\n- If Jack is a trick-shot artist, then by premise 1, he does not struggle with half court shots (¬StruggleAt(jack, halfCourtShot)).\n- If Jack is good at shooting threes, then we will analyze further based on that.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of Jack being a trick-shot artist\nIf Jack is a trick-shot artist, then he does not struggle with half court shots.

Therefore, the conclusion is not valid based on the premises.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Jack is solid at shooting 2-pointers or successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers, then Jack struggles at half court shots and is bad at mid-range shots\" is False."

This means that Singh Kaur is included in the category of musicians who are famous. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of being a famous musician\nFrom premise 3, we see that if a musician is not famous, they will not make a lot of money. However, since Singh Kaur is famous, this premise does not apply to him. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Singh Kaur's financial status based on this premise.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the types of musicians\nPremise 4 states that a musician can be either a singer or a writer. Since Singh Kaur is a musician, he must fall into one of these categories (singer or writer). However, the premise does not specify which category he belongs to.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince we know that Singh Kaur is a musician and can be either a singer or a writer, but we do not have any additional information to definitively categorize him as a writer, we cannot conclude that \"Singh Kaur is a writer.\" Therefore, the conclusion remains uncertain.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Singh Kaur is a writer.\" is Uncertain."

Thus, the conclusion that \"Peter grows his own fresh vegetables in their home garden or is a young working professional who lives in large cities\" is true because at least one part of the disjunction (growing vegetables) must be true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Peter grows his own fresh vegetables in their home garden or is a young working professional who lives in large cities\" is True."

Thus, we can conclude:\n- EasyToOperate(modelXX)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Step 1.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Analyze the connection to Google Home\nAt this point, we have established that ModelXX is connected to the company's wifi.

Premise 1 states that all devices belonging to the company are connected to Google Home, but we do not have any information indicating that ModelXX belongs to the company. We only know that it belongs to an employee.\n\nSince we do not have any premise that directly connects ModelXX to the company, we cannot conclude that ModelXX is connected to Google Home. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the truth of the conclusion.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Step 1.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"ModelXX is connected to Google Home\" is Unknown because we cannot establish whether ModelXX belongs to the company based on the given premises."

Case 1: Harry yells\n   - If Harry yells, then he is not cool (from premise 1).\n   - If Harry is angry, he yells (from premise 2), which means he cannot be both angry and cool.\n   - Therefore, if Harry yells, he cannot be angry and cool at the same time.\n\n2. Case 2: Harry flies\n   - If Harry flies, then he is cool (from premise 3).\n   - If Harry is not cool, he cannot be yelling (from premise 1).\n   - Therefore, if Harry flies, he cannot be angry.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that Harry is neither a wizard nor angry:\n- ¬Wizard(harry) ∧ ¬Angry(harry)\n\nFrom premise 4 and 5, we know that all wizards know magic and every person who knows magic flies. Since Potter is a wizard and flies, it implies that Harry could also be a wizard if he knows magic. However, we do not have direct evidence that Harry is a wizard or not.\n\nStep 6: Determine the truth of the conclusion\n- If Harry yells, he is not cool, and if he is angry, he yells, which means he cannot be both angry and cool.\n- If Harry flies, he is cool, which means he cannot be angry.\n- Since Harry must either yell or fly, and both cases lead to contradictions regarding being cool or angry, we can conclude that Harry cannot be angry.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively conclude that Harry is not a wizard based on the premises provided. Therefore, the conclusion that \"Harry is neither a wizard nor angry\" is partially true (he is not angry) but we cannot confirm the wizard status.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Harry is neither a wizard nor angry\" is True regarding the anger part, but we cannot confirm the wizard part, so the overall conclusion is Unknown."

All of this brand's products produced in the US are sold in the US. \n4. The products of this brand that are labeled are cheaper.\n5.

None of this brand's products that are returned by customers are sold at Walmart. \n8.

However, if it is sold at Walmart, it cannot be returned by customers (as per premise 7). \n\nRequired: Premise 6, Premise 7.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of G-910 not being displayed on the homepage\nIf G-910 is not displayed on the homepage, then it is not sold at Walmart (since displayed products are sold at Walmart). Therefore, if G-910 is not displayed on the homepage, it could potentially be returned by customers. \n\nRequired: Premise 6.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince G-910 cannot be both sold at Walmart and returned by customers (as per premise 7), we have two scenarios:\n1. If G-910 is displayed on the homepage, it is sold at Walmart and cannot be returned.\n2. If G-910 is not displayed on the homepage, it is not sold at Walmart, and it could be returned by customers.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"G-910 is a product returned by customers or sold in Walmart\" is true because if it is not sold at Walmart, it can be returned by customers.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"G-910 is a product returned by customers or sold in Walmart\" is True."

This means that not all crimes will be personally investigated by the prosecutor, only those classified as special crimes. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor investigates all crimes personally when the police complete investigations.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conclusion's claim\nThe conclusion states that for any crime y, if the police complete the investigation of that crime, then the prosecutor will investigate personally. However, from premise 2, we see that the prosecutor's personal investigation is limited to special crimes. Thus, the conclusion does not hold for all crimes, as it does not specify that the crime must be a special crime.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of the premises\nPremise 4 states that once the police complete investigations, evidence is handed to the prosecutor. However, this does not imply that the prosecutor will personally investigate every crime. The prosecutor's involvement is contingent upon the nature of the crime (i.e., whether it is a special crime or not). Therefore, the conclusion that the prosecutor investigates personally for all crimes is not supported by the premises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"When the police complete investigations, the prosecutor investigates personally\" is False because it overgeneralizes the role of the prosecutor, who only investigates personally in cases of special crimes, not all crimes. \n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion is False."

Since Jack is either a human or a phone (as per premise 7), we need to explore the implications of Jack being a phone.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between cell phones and phones.\nFrom the second premise, we have:\n2. ∀x (Cellphone(x) → Phone(x))\n\nThis means that if something is a cell phone, then it is also a phone. Since all iPhones are cell phones (premise 3), it follows that all iPhones are also phones.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Analyze the relationship between employees and wage earners.\nFrom the fourth premise, we have:\n3. ∀x (Employee(x) → WageEarner(x))\n\nThis means that if someone is an employee, then they are a wage earner. Additionally, from the fifth premise:\n4. ∀x (WageEarner(x) → Human(x))\n\nThis means that if someone is a wage earner, then they are human. Therefore, if Jack is an employee, he is also a wage earner and consequently a human.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Analyze Jack's status as either an employee or a wage earner.\nFrom the sixth premise, we have:\n5. Employee(jack) ⊕ WageEarner(jack)\n\nThis means Jack is either an employee or a wage earner. If Jack is an employee, he is a human (from Step 3). If Jack is a wage earner, he is also a human (from Step 3). Thus, in either case, Jack is a human.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Analyze Jack's status as either a human or a phone.\nFrom the seventh premise, we have:\n6. Human(jack) ⊕ Phone(jack)\n\nThis means Jack is either a human or a phone. From Step 4, we established that Jack is a human. Therefore, we can conclude that Jack is not a phone.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 7, Step 4.\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Determine if Jack is a thing.\nSince we have established that Jack is a human, we can use the fact that all humans are things (though this is not explicitly stated in the premises, it is a reasonable assumption based on the context). Therefore, Jack, being a human, is also a thing.\n\nPremises and steps required: Implicit assumption that Human(x) → Thing(x).\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Jack is a thing\" is True based on the premises and logical deductions made."

This can be interpreted as:\n- If Fabien studies Spanish (which he does, as per premise 5), then he cannot like eating cheese. Therefore, we conclude:\n- ¬LikeEating(fabien, cheese)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of the premises\nNow, let's analyze the implications of the other premises:\n- Premise 1 states that there is at least one person in Benji's family who either likes eating cheese or is a francophile.\n- Premise 2 states that no francophile in Benji's family has Spain as their favorite country.\n- Premise 3 states that there is at least one person in Benji's family who either likes eating cheese or has Spain as their favorite country.\n\nSince we have established that Fabien does not like eating cheese, we need to consider the implications of the other premises. \n\nStep 3: Consider the possibilities\n- If Fabien does not like eating cheese, then for premise 1 to hold true, there must be another person in Benji's family who likes eating cheese or is a francophile.\n- Premise 3 also supports this, as it states that there is someone in Benji's family who likes eating cheese or has Spain as their favorite country. \n\nHowever, since we have established that Fabien cannot like eating cheese, we cannot conclude that he does. \n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Fabien is a person who likes eating cheese\" is False based on the premises, as we have established that he cannot like eating cheese due to his studying Spanish.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Fabien is a person who likes eating cheese\" is False."

However, if he were a francophile, he would not favor Spain.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion's consequent\nThe consequent of the conclusion states:\n- ¬(Study(fabien, spanish) ∨ Francophile(fabien))\n\nSince we know that Fabien studies Spanish (premise 5), the expression Study(fabien, spanish) is true. Therefore, the entire expression ¬(Study(fabien, spanish) ∨ Francophile(fabien)) is false, regardless of whether Fabien is a francophile or not.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion states that if Fabien is either a person who likes eating cheese or a francophile, then Fabien is neither a person who studies Spanish nor a person who is a francophile. Since we have established that the consequent is false, the implication as a whole is true because a false consequent makes the implication true regardless of the truth of the antecedent.\n\nThus, the conclusion is True."

The conclusion states:\n(Favor(fabien, spain) ∨ Francophile(fabien)) → (Study(fabien, spanish) ⊕ Favor(fabien, spain))\n\nIf we assume the antecedent (Favor(fabien, spain) ∨ Francophile(fabien)), we need to determine the truth of the consequent (Study(fabien, spanish) ⊕ Favor(fabien, spain)).\n\n- We know from premise 5 that Study(fabien, spanish) is true.\n- The exclusive OR (⊕) means that one of the statements must be true, but not both.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the antecedent\nNow, let's analyze the antecedent:\n- If Fabien is a francophile, then from premise 2, he cannot favor Spain (since there is no francophile in Benji's family whose favorite country is Spain). Thus, if Francophile(fabien) is true, then Favor(fabien, spain) must be false.\n- If Favor(fabien, spain) is true, then the antecedent is satisfied, but we need to check the consequent.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the consequent\nIf Favor(fabien, spain) is true, then the consequent (Study(fabien, spanish) ⊕ Favor(fabien, spain)) is true because Study(fabien, spanish) is also true.\n\nHowever, if Fabien is a francophile, then Favor(fabien, spain) is false, and the consequent becomes:\n- True (Study(fabien, spanish)) ⊕ False (Favor(fabien, spain)), which is true.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nIn both cases (whether Fabien is a francophile or favors Spain), the consequent holds true. Therefore, the implication in the conclusion is satisfied.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that if Fabien is a person who likes Spain as their favorite country or is a francophile, then Fabien is either a person who studies Spanish or a person who likes Spain as their favorite country. Since we established that Fabien cannot like both Spanish and cheese, and we have no evidence that he likes Spain, the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"(Favor(fabien, spain) ∨ Francophile(fabien)) → (Study(fabien, spanish) ⊕ Favor(fabien, spain))\" is False because it does not hold under the conditions established by the premises."

Some people who aren’t chefs can cook.\n3. People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n4. If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n5. Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n6. Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nPremises-FOL:\n1. ∀x (Chef(x) → Can(x, cook))\n2. ∃x (¬Chef(x) ∧ Can(x, cook))\n3. ∀x (Can(x, cook) → (CanMake(x, scrambledEggs) ∧ CanMake(x, pasta)))\n4. ∀x (CanMake(x, cookies) ∧ CanMake(x, muffins) → Baker(x))\n5. ∀x ((Baker(x) ∧ CanMake(x, scrambledEggs)) → CanMake(x, goodBreakfast))\n6. CanMake(luke, cookies) ∧ (CanMake(luke, scrambledEggs) ∧ CanMake(luke, muffins) ∧ ¬CanMake(luke, pasta)\n\nConclusion:\nLuke is a chef.\nConclusion-FOL:\nChef(luke)\n\n### Solution:\n\nStep 1: Analyze Luke's cooking abilities\nFrom premise 6, we know that:\n- CanMake(luke, cookies)\n- CanMake(luke, scrambledEggs)\n- CanMake(luke, muffins)\n- ¬CanMake(luke, pasta)\n\nSince Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, we can apply premise 4:\n- From CanMake(luke, cookies) ∧ CanMake(luke, muffins), we conclude that Baker(luke).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6, Premise 4.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of being a baker\nSince we have established that Luke is a baker, we can now analyze what this means in relation to the premises. According to premise 5:\n- If Baker(luke) and CanMake(luke, scrambledEggs), then CanMake(luke, goodBreakfast).\n\nThis means that Luke can make a good breakfast, but it does not provide any information about whether he is a chef or not.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of not being a chef\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are some people who can cook but are not chefs. This means that it is possible for Luke to be one of those people. \n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Luke were a chef, he would be able to cook. However, since we have established that he is a baker and can cook, it does not necessarily imply that he is a chef.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nSince we have established that Luke is a baker and can cook, but we also know that there are people who can cook and are not chefs, we cannot conclude that Luke is a chef. Therefore, the conclusion \"Luke is a chef\" is False.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Luke is a chef.\" is False."

Robert is a hodophile, and he either enjoys eating gelato ice cream and loves to travel and vacation often, or does not enjoy eating gelato ice cream and does not love to travel and vacation often.\n\n### Premises-FOL:\n1. ∀x (Hodophiles(x) ∧ EnjoyEating(x, gelato) → Enjoy(x, vacationToItaly))\n2. ∀x (Hodophiles(x) ∧ ¬(∃y (Resist(x, y) ∧ Hallmark(y) ∧ Delectabl(y) ∧ Dessert(y) ∧ FamousIn(y, italy))))\n3. ∀x (Hodophiles(x) → (EnjoyEating(x, gelato) ∨ LoveToTravelOften(x)))\n4. ∀x (Hodophiles(x) ∧ TakeIn(x, studyAbroadSemester, europe) → ¬Regret(x, collegeExperience))\n5. ∀x (Hodophiles(x) ∧ LoveToTravelOften(x) → TakeIn(x, studyAbroadSemester, europe))\n6.

This can be expressed as:\n- Case 1: EnjoyEating(robert, gelato) ∧ LoveToTravelOften(robert)\n- Case 2: ¬EnjoyEating(robert, gelato) ∧ ¬LoveToTravelOften(robert)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Case 1\nIf Case 1 is true (Robert enjoys eating gelato and loves to travel), then from premise 1, Robert would enjoy a vacation to Italy. Thus, the conclusion would hold true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Case 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Case 2\nIf Case 2 is true (Robert does not enjoy eating gelato and does not love to travel), then:\n- From premise 2, since Robert is a hodophile, he cannot resist the hallmark delectable desserts famous in Italy. Therefore, it must be true that he can resist them, which contradicts the premise.\n- Additionally, if Robert does not love to travel, then from premise 5, he does not study abroad in Europe, which means from premise 4, he does not regret his college experiences. \n\nThus, if Robert does not enjoy eating gelato and does not love to travel, he cannot fulfill the conditions of the conclusion.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 4, Premise 5, Case 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that if Robert is not both a person who can resist the hallmark delectable desserts and regrets his college experiences, then Robert either enjoys eating gelato ice cream or would enjoy a vacation to Italy. \n- If we assume Robert does not resist the desserts (which is true for all hodophiles) and does not regret his college experiences (which is also true if he does not study abroad), then the antecedent of the implication is true.\n- However, the consequent states that Robert either enjoys eating gelato or would enjoy a vacation to Italy. Since we established that in Case 2, Robert does not enjoy either, the conclusion fails.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 4, Premise 5, Step 3.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Robert is not both a person who can resist the hallmark delectable desserts that are famous in Italy and regrets his college experiences, then Robert either enjoys eating gelato ice cream or would enjoy a vacation to Italy\" is False."

According to premise 1, this means that either Matt invests in the public stock market regularly or enjoys gambling regularly. However, from premise 6, we know that Matt does not invest in the public stock market regularly. Therefore, it must be the case that Matt enjoys gambling regularly.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 6, Premise 7.\n\nStep 2: Analyze gambling behavior\nSince Matt enjoys gambling regularly (from Step 1), we can apply premise 3. This tells us that if Matt enjoys gambling regularly, then he spends a lot of money at casinos or other betting games. Therefore, we conclude that Matt spends a lot of money at casinos or other betting games.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the risk of gambling addiction\nFrom Step 2, we know that Matt spends a lot of money at casinos or other betting games. According to premise 5, if someone spends a lot of money at casinos or other betting games, they are at risk of gambling addiction. Therefore, we conclude that Matt is at risk of gambling addiction.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Matt's reading habits and visiting preferences\nThe conclusion states that Mike does not both read the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers regularly and visit the Las Vegas Strip regularly. However, we have established that Matt enjoys gambling regularly, which implies he spends a lot of money at casinos (Step 2). According to premise 4, if Matt spends a lot of money at casinos, he would enjoy visiting the Las Vegas Strip. Therefore, Matt enjoys visiting the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nNow, we need to analyze whether Matt reads the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers regularly. Since Matt does not invest in the public stock market regularly (premise 6), we cannot conclude that he reads the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers regularly (premise 2). Thus, we cannot definitively state that Matt does not read the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers regularly.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 4, Premise 6.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion states that \"Matt is not at risk of a gambling addiction\" is False, as we have established that he is at risk. The second part of the conclusion regarding Mike's reading habits and visiting preferences is also uncertain because we cannot definitively conclude that Matt does not read the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers regularly.\n\nThus, the overall conclusion is False."

Premise 2 states that each player starts at the red stage. Premise 4 confirms that the yellow stage comes after the red stage. Therefore, players must first reach the yellow stage before they can reach the green stage.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premises 1, 2, 4.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Analyze the requirement to reach the yellow stage\nPremise 3 states that if a player has not reached the yellow stage, they cannot reach the green stage. This means that reaching the yellow stage is a prerequisite for reaching the green stage. Premise 5 reinforces this by stating that if a player starts at the red stage and has not reached the yellow stage, they cannot reach the green stage.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premises 3, 5.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of completing the game without reaching the green stage\nTo complete the game without reaching the green stage, a player must be able to finish the game while remaining at the red or yellow stage. However, based on the premises, a player must reach the yellow stage after starting at the red stage. Once they reach the yellow stage, they are still required to reach the green stage to complete the game, as there is no indication in the premises that a player can complete the game without reaching the green stage.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premises 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n---\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, it is clear that a player cannot complete the game without reaching the green stage, as reaching the yellow stage is a necessary step to eventually reach the green stage. Therefore, the conclusion \"It is possible to complete the game without ever reaching the green stage\" is False.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"It is possible to complete the game without ever reaching the green stage\" is False."

However, we only have information about one specific movie (EndGame). While we know that EndGame was filmed outside of Washington, we do not have any information about other movies directed by Andy Chang. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the existence of other movies\nPremise 4 states that some movies are filmed in New York, but it does not specify whether these movies are directed by Andy Chang or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that all of Andy Chang's movies are filmed outside of Washington based solely on the information provided.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"All of Andy Chang's movies are filmed outside of Washington\" is Uncertain because we only have evidence for one movie (EndGame) and no information about other movies directed by Andy Chang. Thus, we cannot generalize the conclusion to all of his movies."

According to premise 3, this means that Mei must be either a PRC national or a French national, but not both. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Premise 7.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of Mei being a North Korean national.\nIf Mei were a North Korean national, then according to premise 6, she would not be a citizen of the European Union. However, premise 8 states that either Mei is a North Korean and can have her medical bills partially covered, or neither is true. If she is a North Korean, she cannot have her medical bills partially covered because North Korean nationals are not entitled to national social insurance coverage (as they are not PRC nationals or French nationals). This leads to a contradiction.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6, Premise 8.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of Mei being a Spanish national.\nIf Mei is a Spanish national, then according to premise 5, she is a citizen of the European Union. However, if she is a Spanish national, she cannot be a PRC national (from premise 3). Therefore, she cannot be a French national either. This means that if Mei is a Spanish national, she is not a French national and is a citizen of the European Union.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states that if Mei is either a North Korean or a Spanish national, then she is either both a French national and a citizen of the European Union, or neither a French national nor a citizen of the European Union. \n\n- If Mei is a North Korean, we established that she cannot be a citizen of the European Union (premise 6), and thus she cannot be a French national either.\n- If Mei is a Spanish national, she is a citizen of the European Union but not a French national.\n\nIn both cases, the conclusion holds true: if Mei is either a North Korean or a Spanish national, then she is neither a French national nor a citizen of the European Union.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 2, Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Mei is either a North Korean or a Spanish national, then Mei is either both a French national and a citizen of the European Union, or neither a French national nor a citizen of the European Union\" is True."

This can be interpreted as saying that all good teachers must admit mistakes. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n- If someone is a good teacher, they must admit a mistake.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise\nThe second premise states that there exist some well-informed people who do not admit a mistake. This means:\n- There are individuals (let's call them A and B) such that both A and B are well-informed and do not admit a mistake.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Combine the implications from both premises\nFrom Step 1, we know that good teachers must admit a mistake. From Step 2, we have identified well-informed individuals (A and B) who do not admit a mistake. Therefore, these well-informed individuals cannot be good teachers because they do not meet the requirement of admitting a mistake.\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 1 and 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that some good teachers are not well-informed people. However, based on the analysis:\n- We have established that well-informed people (A and B) do not admit mistakes and therefore cannot be good teachers.\n- This does not provide evidence that there are good teachers who are not well-informed, as we have not established the existence of any good teachers at all.\n\nThus, we cannot definitively conclude that some good teachers are not well-informed people based on the given premises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 1, 2, and 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Some good teachers are not well-informed people\" is Uncertain. We cannot confirm or deny the existence of good teachers based on the provided premises."

This means there exists at least one tourist attraction that John will see if he goes to Europe.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Identify the tourist attractions in Europe\nFrom premise 3, we know:\n- The Eiffel Tower is a tourist attraction located in Paris, which is in France (and thus in Europe). \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Consider John's ability to see the Eiffel Tower\nSince the Eiffel Tower is a tourist attraction in Europe, and premise 5 states that if John goes to Europe, he will see some tourist attractions, it is possible that the Eiffel Tower is one of the attractions he could see. However, premise 5 does not guarantee that he will see the Eiffel Tower specifically; it only states that he will see some tourist attractions.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Analyze John's language skills\nPremise 6 states that John speaks French. While this may suggest that he could communicate in France, it does not directly influence whether he will see the Eiffel Tower when he goes to Europe.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If John goes to Europe, he will see the Eiffel Tower\" is Uncertain. While it is possible that he could see the Eiffel Tower, the premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that he will see it specifically. \n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If John goes to Europe, he will see the Eiffel Tower.\" is Uncertain."

This is represented as:\n- ∀x ∀y (HandbrakeOf(x, y) ∧ Car(y) → Up(x) ⊕ Down(x))\n\nThis means that for any handbrake associated with a car, it cannot be both up and down at the same time; it must be one or the other.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise\nThe second premise states that if a car is parked, then the handbrake must be down:\n- ∀x ∀y (HandbrakeOf(x, y) ∧ Parked(y) ∧ Car(y) → Down(x))\n\nThis means that whenever a car is parked, the handbrake associated with that car is definitely down.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion's claim\nThe conclusion states that there exists some handbrake and some car such that the handbrake is up when the car is parked:\n- ∃x ∃y (HandbrakeOf(x, y) ∧ Parked(y) ∧ Car(y) ∧ Up(x))\n\nHowever, from the second premise, we know that if a car is parked, the handbrake must be down. Therefore, it is impossible for the handbrake to be up at the same time that the car is parked.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\n---\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"The handbrake is up when some cars are parked\" is False because it directly contradicts the information provided in the premises. When a car is parked, the handbrake must be down, not up. \n\nThus, the conclusion is definitively false based on the premises provided."

This can be expressed as:\n- Either (Have(manny, horseRanch) ∧ LiveIn(manny, crampedBuilding)) or ¬(Have(manny, horseRanch) ⊕ LiveIn(manny, crampedBuilding)).\n\nThis means that if she has a horse ranch, she cannot live in a cramped building, and if she lives in a cramped building, she cannot have a horse ranch. Therefore, she must be in one of the following situations:\n- She has a horse ranch and does not live in a cramped building.\n- She does not have a horse ranch and lives in a cramped building.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of having a horse ranch.\nIf Manny has a horse ranch (Have(manny, horseRanch)), then by premise 1, she regularly rides horses for pleasure (RegularlyRideHorseForPleasure(manny)). By premise 5, if she regularly rides horses for pleasure, then she does not live in a cramped building (¬LiveIn(manny, crampedBuilding)).

By premise 2, if she has disposable income, then she must have a horse ranch (Have(manny, horseRanch)). This leads to a contradiction because if she has a horse ranch, she cannot live in a cramped building, which is consistent with our earlier analysis.\n\nThus, if she competes in horse dressage shows, she must also have a horse ranch, which means she cannot live in a cramped building.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Premise 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states that if Manny either has a horse ranch or competes in horse dressage shows, then she has not invested in high-quality equestrian gear and equipment. \n\nFrom our analysis:\n- If she has a horse ranch, she regularly rides horses for pleasure, which means she does not live in a cramped building. \n- If she competes in horse dressage shows, she has disposable income and must have a horse ranch, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nHowever, if she has a horse ranch or competes in horse dressage shows, she must have invested in high-quality equestrian gear and equipment (from premise 4). Therefore, the conclusion that she has not invested in high-quality equestrian gear and equipment is false.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Manny either has a horse ranch or competes in horse dressage shows, then Manny has not invested in high-quality equestrian equipment and gear\" is False."

People in this tech company who have very high energy and are impulsive like surprises.\n6. Mike works in this tech company.\n7. If Mike is not a person who wears the same flannel shirts every day, has very high energy, and is impulsive, then Mike either is very consistent and enjoys sticking to his regular routines or does not like surprises.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIf Mike wears the same flannel shirts every day or does not like shopping for clothes, then Mike is neither an old person living in a stable home nor does he like shopping for clothes.\n\n### Conclusion-FOL:\n(∃y (flannelShirt(y) ∧ WearEveryday(mike, y)) ∨ ¬LikeShoppingFor(mike, clothes)) → ¬(Old(mike) ∧ LiveIn(mike, stableHome)) ∧ ¬LikeShoppingFor(mike, clothes)\n\n### Solution:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the implications of Mike's clothing habits\n- From premise 2, if Mike wears the same flannel shirts every day, then he is consistent and enjoys sticking to his regular routines. Therefore, he does not like surprises (from premise 1).\n- From premise 3, if Mike does not like shopping for clothes, he must wear the same flannel shirts every day. Thus, if he does not like shopping for clothes, he is also consistent and enjoys sticking to his regular routines, leading to him not liking surprises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conclusion's claim\n- The conclusion states that if Mike wears the same flannel shirts every day or does not like shopping for clothes, then he is neither an old person living in a stable home nor does he like shopping for clothes.\n- If Mike wears the same flannel shirts every day, he does not like surprises. If he does not like shopping for clothes, he also wears the same flannel shirts every day. In both cases, Mike does not like surprises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of Mike's age and living situation\n- The conclusion states that Mike is neither old nor living in a stable home. However, we do not have any premises that directly link Mike's age or living situation to his clothing habits or preferences. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Mike is not old or living in a stable home based solely on the information provided.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5, Premise 6.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion states that if Mike wears the same flannel shirts every day or does not like shopping for clothes, then he is neither an old person living in a stable home nor does he like shopping for clothes. Given that we cannot definitively determine Mike's age or living situation based on the premises, the conclusion remains True because it does not contradict any premises and is logically consistent with the information provided.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion is True."

Therefore, we can denote:\n- City1 = San Francisco\n- City2 = Los Angeles\n- City3 = San Diego\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Mr. Smith's travel history.\nFrom premise 4, we know that Mr. Smith has visited two cities in California.

Therefore, the bird cannot be big.\n\n- If the bird is small:\n  - By premise 3, it would be light (Light(bird)).\n  - By premise 5, if it is light, it must be unstable (Unstable(bird)).\n  - Since it is unstable, by premise 6, it must be changing (Changing(bird)).\n  - Also, by premise 7, it must be unpredictable (Unpredictable(bird)).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2, Premise 3, Premise 4, Premise 5, Premise 6, Premise 7.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion based on the bird's characteristics.\nSince we have established that the bird must be small, it is light, unstable, changing, and unpredictable.

This means that either:\n- The bird is not heavy, or\n- The bird is not still.\n\nIf the bird is not heavy, we can analyze further:\n- If the bird is not heavy, then it cannot be still (from premise 4, since all heavy things are still). Therefore, the bird must be light (from premise 3, since if it is small, it is light).\n\nIf the bird is light, then according to premise 5, it must be unstable. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 8, Premise 4, Premise 3, Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of the bird being unstable.\nSince the bird is unstable, we can apply premises 6 and 7:\n- From premise 6, if the bird is unstable, then it is changing.\n- From premise 7, if the bird is unstable, then it is unpredictable.\n\nThus, if the bird is light (and therefore unstable), it must be both changing and unpredictable.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 6, Premise 7.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states: If the bird is small or still, then it is either unpredictable or changing. \n\n- If the bird is small, it is light (from premise 3), which means it is unstable, and thus it is both changing and unpredictable.\n- If the bird is still, we know from premise 8 that it cannot be both heavy and still, which means it cannot be heavy. Therefore, it must be light (and thus unstable), leading to the same conclusion that it is changing and unpredictable.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that it is either unpredictable or changing (using the exclusive OR, denoted by ⊕). Since we have established that the bird is both changing and unpredictable, the conclusion is not valid as it does not hold true under the exclusive OR condition.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Premise 5, Premise 6, Premise 7.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If the bird is small or still, then it is either unpredictable or changing\" is False because the conclusion uses an exclusive OR (⊕) which does not hold true since the bird is both changing and unpredictable."

But if he owns a coffeemaker and a blender, he cannot order takeout. Therefore, if Sam is busy, he cannot own both a coffeemaker and a blender. \n\nIf Sam is not busy, he cannot be addicted to coffee and cannot own a coffeemaker and a blender either, as it would lead to the same contradiction.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Sam is living in this neighborhood and he owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home\" is False because it leads to a contradiction based on the premises provided."

This can be expressed as:\n- Case 1: AddictedTo(sam, coffee) ∧ BusyWith(sam, 12HourWorkHour)\n- Case 2: ¬AddictedTo(sam, coffee) ∧ ¬BusyWith(sam, 12HourWorkHour)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of Case 1.\nIf Case 1 is true (Sam is addicted to coffee and leads a busy life), then:\n- From premise 5, since Sam is busy with 12-hour work hours, he makes a lot of his own food at home using recipes.\n- From premise 3, since he makes a lot of his own food, he must order takeout at least once a day.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of Case 2.\nIf Case 2 is true (Sam is not addicted to coffee and does not lead a busy life), then:\n- From premise 1, since he is not addicted to coffee, he must visit the coffee shop regularly (as per premise 2).\n- However, if he visits the coffee shop regularly, then from premise 1, he must be addicted to coffee, which contradicts Case 2.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion based on the cases.\nIn Case 1, Sam orders takeout at least once a day. In Case 2, we reach a contradiction, meaning Case 2 cannot be true. Therefore, Case 1 must be true, which means Sam orders takeout at least once a day.\n\nNow, we need to check if Sam owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender:\n- If Sam owns a coffeemaker and a blender (premise 4), he cannot order takeout at least once a day. However, since we established that he does order takeout, he cannot own both a coffeemaker and a blender.\n\nThus, the conclusion that Sam either owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender or orders takeout at least once a day is true because he does order takeout at least once a day.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Sam is living in this neighborhood and he owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home or orders takeout at least once a day\" is True."

This directly contradicts the conclusion that states WorkAt(mary, pool). Therefore, we can conclude that the part of the conclusion stating that Mary works at a pool is False.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of Mary not working at a pool\nSince Mary does not work at a pool, we can analyze the implications of this fact. According to premise 4, if someone is a lifeguard, then they work at a pool. Since Mary does not work at a pool, it follows that Mary cannot be a lifeguard. \n\nAdditionally, from premise 3, since all pool managers are lifeguards, and Mary is not a lifeguard, she cannot be a pool manager either. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 3, Premise 5.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion about Mary being a teacher\nThe conclusion states that Mary is a teacher (Teacher(mary)). However, we have no premises that confirm or deny whether Mary is a teacher. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Mary is a teacher or not based on the given premises.\n\nPremises and steps required: None (no premises confirm or deny Teacher(mary)).\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nSince we have established that Mary does not work at a pool (which contradicts the conclusion), and we cannot confirm whether she is a teacher, the conclusion \"Mary is a nice teacher working at a pool\" is False.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Mary is a nice teacher working at a pool.\" is False."

This creates a situation where if Emily lives with a roommate, she cannot own pets, and if she owns pets, she must live with a roommate.\n\nStep 6: Analyze premise 7\nPremise 7 is a conditional statement about Emily's ownership of pets and her living situation.

This premise is complex and does not provide direct information about whether Emily enjoys reading about tech specs.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion\nTo conclude that Emily enjoys reading about tech specs and keeping up to date on the latest technology, we would need to establish that she upgrades to the newest iPhone model every year (from premise 2).

Nancy teaches students.\n\n### Premises-FOL:\n1. ∀x (OnPayroll(x) → PaidBy(x, school))\n2. ∀x (HaveJobAt(x, school) → OnPayroll(x))\n3. ∀x (FacultyMember(x) → HaveJobAt(x, school))\n4. ∀x (Teach(x, student) → FacultyMember(x) ∨ Teacher(x))\n5. ∀x (Teacher(x) → Have(x, student))\n6. Teacher(nancy) → OnPayroll(nancy)\n7. ¬Teacher(nancy) → ¬OnPayroll(nancy)\n8. Teach(nancy, student)\n\n### Conclusion:\nNancy is a faculty member.\n### Conclusion-FOL:\nFacultyMember(nancy)\n\n### Solution:\n\nStep 1: Analyze Nancy's teaching status\nFrom premise 8, we know that Nancy teaches students: `Teach(nancy, student)`. \n\nStep 2: Apply the teaching premise\nUsing premise 4, since Nancy teaches students, we can conclude:\n`Teach(nancy, student) → FacultyMember(nancy) ∨ Teacher(nancy)`. \nThis means Nancy is either a faculty member or a teacher.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of being a teacher\nIf Nancy is a teacher, then from premise 6, we have:\n`Teacher(nancy) → OnPayroll(nancy)`. \nThis means if Nancy is a teacher, she is on the payroll.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6, Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of not being a teacher\nFrom premise 7, if Nancy is not a teacher, then:\n`¬Teacher(nancy) → ¬OnPayroll(nancy)`. \nThis means if Nancy is not a teacher, she is not on the payroll.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 7.\n\nStep 5: Determine Nancy's payroll status\nIf we assume Nancy is a teacher, she is on the payroll. If we assume she is not a teacher, she is not on the payroll. However, we need to determine if she is indeed a teacher or not.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the faculty member status\nFrom premise 3, if Nancy is a faculty member, she must have a job at the school, which means she is on the payroll. However, we do not have direct evidence that Nancy is a faculty member, only that she teaches students.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion\nSince we know Nancy teaches students, she could either be a faculty member or a teacher. However, we cannot definitively conclude that she is a faculty member based solely on the premises provided. Therefore, the conclusion \"Nancy is a faculty member\" remains uncertain.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2, Step 4, Step 5, Step 6.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Nancy is a faculty member.\" is Uncertain."

This can be expressed as:\n- If Kat works well in teams, then she is tired: WorkWellInTeamsIn(kat, workPlace) → AlwaysTiredInMorning(kat)\n- If Kat is not tired, then she does not work well in teams: ¬AlwaysTiredInMorning(kat) → ¬WorkWellInTeamsIn(kat, workPlace)\n\nThis means that if Kat is tired, she could potentially work well in teams, but if she is not tired, she cannot work well in teams.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze premise 3\nPremise 3 states that people either come to work with a positive attitude or are always tired. This means for Kat:\n- If she is not coming to work with a positive attitude, then she must be tired: ¬ComeToWorkWithEveryDay(kat, positiveAttitude) → AlwaysTiredInMorning(kat)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of being tired\nIf Kat is always tired (from premise 3), then according to premise 4, she would be criticized by her boss. Following that, from premise 5, if she is criticized, she would not receive positive feedback from her teams. \n\nThus, if Kat is tired, she cannot be working well in teams (as she would not receive positive feedback).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of having a positive attitude\nIf Kat comes to work every day with a positive attitude (from premise 2), then she works well in teams. However, if she works well in teams, she must get along with her colleagues (from premise 1). \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 1.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nFrom the analysis:\n- If Kat is tired, she cannot work well in teams, and thus she cannot have a positive attitude.\n- If Kat has a positive attitude, she must work well in teams, which contradicts the possibility of her being tired.\n\nSince premise 6 states that Kat is either in one state or the other, we cannot definitively conclude whether she comes to work with a positive attitude or is always tired. Therefore, the conclusion that \"Kat is a person who comes to work every day with a positive attitude\" remains Uncertain.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Kat is a person who comes to work every day with a positive attitude.\" is Uncertain."

Therefore, Wang's score must be:\n- GreaterThan90 (since it is better than Zhang's score)\n- LowerThan95 (since it cannot be equal to or greater than 95, as Zhang's score is less than 95)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Wu's score\nFrom premise 6, we know that Wu's English class score is lower than 90. According to premise 7, if a student's score is lower than 90, then it is not greater than 95 or 90, and lower than 95. This means Wu's score does not affect the comparison between Zhang and Wang.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6, Premise 7.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the possibility of Wang getting an A+\nAccording to premise 2, if a student gets an A+, their score must be greater than 95. However, we have established that Wang's score is greater than 90 but lower than 95. Therefore, it is impossible for Wang to have received an A+.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Step 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Wang got an A+ in English class\" is False."

Therefore, the statement \"James is a customer who chooses the Prime Video plan or does not choose any plans\" is problematic because it contradicts premise 3, which states that there are no customers who do not choose any plan.

Therefore, Jojo must be a cat.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Step 1.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Jojo is a cat or a ghost, then Jojo either barks or is a dog\" is false because Jojo cannot bark (it is dead) and cannot be a dog (as established). Therefore, the conclusion does not hold true.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Jojo is a cat or a ghost, then Jojo either barks or is a dog\" is False."

This gives us two possibilities:\n- SoldAt(avocado, localFarmersMarket)\n- SoldAt(avocado, nica'sMarket)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of selling at Nica's market\nIf avocados are sold at Nica's market, then according to premise 1, they must be shipped from Colombia. However, from premise 3, we know that no fruits shipped from Colombia are sold at the local farmers market in New Haven. Therefore, if avocados are sold at Nica's market, they cannot be sold at the local farmers market.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of selling at the local farmers market\nIf avocados are sold at the local farmers market, then they cannot be shipped from Colombia (from premise 3). This means that if avocados are sold at the local farmers market, they must be shipped from Mexico or another location.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the condition from premise 5\nPremise 5 states that avocados are either shipped from Colombia and sold in New Haven, or neither. Since we have established that if avocados are sold at the local farmers market, they cannot be shipped from Colombia, this means that they must be sold at the local farmers market and shipped from Mexico (or another location). \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nSince we have established that avocados cannot be sold at Nica's market (because that would require them to be shipped from Colombia, which contradicts their sale at the local farmers market), and they must be sold at the local farmers market, we can conclude that:\n- Avocados are indeed sold at the local farmers market in New Haven.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Avocados are a kind of fruit sold at the local farmers market in New Haven\" is True.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Avocados are a kind of fruit sold at the local farmers market in New Haven\" is True."

According to premise 4, if a monitor has a resolution lower than 1080p, it does not support the type-c port. Therefore, since A-2017 supports the type-c port, it must have a resolution of at least 1080p.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of A-2017's resolution.\nSince A-2017 has a resolution of at least 1080p, it cannot be true that A-2017 has a resolution lower than 1080p. Thus, we can conclude:\n- ¬ResolutionLessThan(a-2017, p1080) is True.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of A-2017 being produced by AOC.\nFrom premise 1, we know that some monitors in the library are produced by AOC. However, we do not have any information that directly states A-2017 is produced by AOC. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether A-2017 is produced by AOC or not.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion's claim.\nThe conclusion states: \n¬(ResolutionLessThan(a-2017, p1080) ⊕ ProducedBy(x, aOC)) → ¬(In(a-2017, library)).\nSince we have established that ¬ResolutionLessThan(a-2017, p1080) is True, the truth of the conclusion now depends on the truth of ProducedBy(x, aOC).\n\nIf A-2017 is produced by AOC, then the left side of the implication is False (since both parts are True), which means the implication is True regardless of the right side. If A-2017 is not produced by AOC, then the left side is True, and the right side must also be True for the implication to hold. \n\nHowever, we have no information that confirms or denies whether A-2017 is produced by AOC. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether A-2017 is equipped in the library or not.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 3.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If either A-2017 is both with a resolution of 1080p and produced by AOC or it is neither, then it is not equipped in the library\" is True based on the premises, as the conditions lead to a valid logical structure."

According to premise 1, any video game released by Nintendo does not support the PS4 platform. Therefore, if \"Be Lionel\" is in the Pokemon series, it cannot support the PS4 platform.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of \"Be Lionel\" allowing online soccer simulation.\nFrom premise 5, we have two possibilities: either \"Be Lionel\" is in the Pokemon series or it allows users to simulate playing online soccer using licensed players. If \"Be Lionel\" allows online soccer simulation and uses licensed players, then by premise 4, it must be in the FIFA series. However, if it is in the FIFA series, then by premise 3, it must support the PS4 platform.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 4, Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the logical consistency of the two scenarios.\n- If \"Be Lionel\" is in the Pokemon series, it cannot support the PS4 platform (from Step 1).\n- If \"Be Lionel\" allows online soccer simulation, it must be in the FIFA series, which means it must support the PS4 platform (from Step 2).\n\nThese two scenarios cannot both be true simultaneously because one leads to the conclusion that \"Be Lionel\" does not support the PS4 platform, while the other leads to the conclusion that it does support the PS4 platform.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nSince we cannot definitively determine whether \"Be Lionel\" is in the Pokemon series or allows online soccer simulation without leading to a contradiction, the conclusion that \"Be Lionel\" is in the Pokemon series remains Uncertain.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"The video game 'Be Lionel' is in the Pokemon series.\" is Uncertain."

Grass(banana) ∨ Fruit(banana)\n\nConclusion:\nGrapes are food.\nConclusion-FOL:\nFood(grape)\n\n### Solution:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the implications of grass and food\nFrom premise 1, we have that if something is grass, it is not food: \n- ∀x (Grass(x) → ¬Food(x)). \nThis means that any object classified as grass cannot be food.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between meadows and grass\nFrom premise 2, we know that all meadows are grass:\n- ∀x (Meadow(x) → Grass(x)). \nThis means that anything classified as a meadow is also classified as grass, and therefore cannot be food.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the relationship between edible things and food\nFrom premise 3, we know that all edible things are food:\n- ∀x (Edible(x) → Food(x)). \nThis means that if something is edible, it must be classified as food.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the relationship between fruits and edibility\nFrom premise 4, we know that all fruits are edible:\n- ∀x (Fruit(x) → Edible(x)). \nThis means that if something is classified as a fruit, it is also classified as edible, and thus must be food according to premise 3.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the relationship between lemons and fruits\nFrom premise 5, we know that all lemons are fruits:\n- ∀x (Lemon(x) → Fruit(x)). \nThis means that if something is classified as a lemon, it is also classified as a fruit, and therefore edible and food.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the relationship between grapes, edibility, and lemons\nFrom premise 6, we know that grapes are not both edible and lemons:\n- ¬(Edible(grape) ∧ Lemon(grape)). \nThis means that grapes cannot be classified as both edible and lemons at the same time. However, this does not directly tell us whether grapes are edible or not.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 7: Analyze the relationship between bananas, grasses, and fruits\nFrom premise 7, we know that bananas are either grasses or fruits:\n- Grass(banana) ∨ Fruit(banana). \nThis means that bananas could be classified as grass (which would mean they are not food) or as fruit (which would mean they are food).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 7.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nTo determine if grapes are food, we need to consider the implications of the premises. \n\n- We know that if grapes are classified as fruits, they would be edible and thus food. However, we do not have any direct evidence that grapes are classified as fruits.\n- Premise 6 indicates that grapes cannot be both edible and lemons, but it does not provide a definitive classification for grapes themselves.\n- Since we cannot conclude definitively whether grapes are edible or not based on the premises provided, we cannot conclude that grapes are food.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Grapes are food\" is Uncertain."

Since all meadows are grass (premise 2), it follows that meadows are also not food. However, this does not directly relate to grapes.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between edible things and food\nFrom the third premise:\n3. ∀x (Edible(x) → Food(x))\nThis means that if something is edible, it is food. This is crucial because it implies that anything that is not food cannot be edible.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Analyze the relationship between fruits and edibility\nFrom the fourth premise:\n4. ∀x (Fruit(x) → Edible(x))\nThis means that if something is a fruit, it is edible. Therefore, all fruits are included in the category of edible things.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Analyze the relationship between lemons and fruits\nFrom the fifth premise:\n5. ∀x (Lemon(x) → Fruit(x))\nThis means that if something is a lemon, it is a fruit. Thus, lemons are also edible (from Step 3).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Analyze the relationship between grapes and lemons\nFrom the sixth premise:\n6. ¬(Edible(grape) ∧ Lemon(grape))\nThis means that grapes cannot be both edible and lemons at the same time. Since lemons are fruits and thus edible, this implies that grapes cannot be edible if they are to remain distinct from lemons.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Analyze the implications for grapes\nSince grapes cannot be both edible and lemons, and since all edible things are food (from Step 2), if grapes are not edible, they cannot be food either. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n¬Edible(grape) → ¬Food(grape)\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that grapes are not food (¬Food(grape)). Based on the analysis in Step 6, if grapes are not edible, they cannot be food. However, we do not have direct evidence that grapes are not edible; we only know they cannot be both edible and lemons. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that grapes are not food.\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 6.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Grapes are not food\" (¬Food(grape)) is Uncertain because while we have established that grapes cannot be edible if they are to remain distinct from lemons, we do not have enough information to definitively state that grapes are not edible, and thus we cannot conclude they are not food."

If a celestial body in the solar system has cleared its orbit of other debris and has a nearly spherical shape due to its own gravity, then it is a planet.\n5. If Europa is a celestial body in the solar system that has cleared its orbit of other debris and has a nearly spherical shape due to its own gravity or relies on nuclear fusion to generate light, then Europa is a celestial body in the solar system. \n\n### Premises-FOL:\n1. ∀x (Planet(x) ∧ In(x, solarSystem) → ¬RelyOnToGenerate(x, nuclearFusion, light))\n2. ∀x (Star(x) ∧ In(x, solarSystem) → RelyOnToGenerate(x, nuclearFusion, light))\n3. ∀x (CelestialBody(x) ∧ In(x, solarSystem) ∧ GreaterThan(x, solarMass, 0.08) → Star(x))\n4. ∀x (CelestialBody(x) ∧ In(x, solarSystem) ∧ (∃y (OrbitOf(y, x) ∧ Clear(x, y) ∧ DebrisFree(y))) ∧ NearlySphericalShape(x, gravity) → Planet(x))\n5.

However, this contradicts premise 1, which states that no planet relies on nuclear fusion.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 1, Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion.\n- The conclusion states that Europa is not a celestial body in one of the solar systems that have greater than 0.08 solar masses. \n- If Europa were a celestial body with a mass greater than 0.08 solar masses, it would have to be a star (from premise 3), which would mean it relies on nuclear fusion (from premise 2). However, if it were a planet, it could not rely on nuclear fusion (from premise 1). Therefore, it cannot be both a planet and a star simultaneously.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"Europa is not a celestial body in one of the solar systems that have greater than 0.08 solar masses\" must be true, as it cannot be a celestial body with that mass without contradicting the premises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2, Premise 3, Premise 5.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Europa is not a celestial body in one of the solar systems that have greater than 0.08 solar masses\" is True."

Therefore, we can conclude that \"Your Woman\" is popular based on its peak position in the UK.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the additional peaks of \"Your Woman\"\nPremise 4 states that \"Your Woman\" peaked at No. 1 in Iceland, Israel, and Spain. This means that \"Your Woman\" is not only popular in the UK but also in these other countries. Since it peaked at No. 1 in multiple locations, we can infer that it is widely recognized and successful.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications for White Town\nSince \"Your Woman\" is popular and has peaked at No. 1 in multiple countries, we can apply premise 3 to conclude that \"Your Woman\" is popular. Given that White Town is the artist behind \"Your Woman\" (from premise 1), we can infer that the success of the song contributes to the success of the band.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Step 1, Step 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nBased on the popularity of \"Your Woman\" and its success in multiple countries, we can conclude that White Town was indeed a successful band.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"White Town was a successful band\" is True."

Since the Hulk is a destroyer and can break a bridge, if the Hulk breaks a bridge, Peter Parker must be a superhero. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 9.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the relationship between Thor's happiness and the Hulk's anger\nFrom premise 10, if Thor is happy, then the Hulk is angry.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Thor is not happy, the Hulk will not wake up and break a bridge.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 10.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Thor is not happy, then no bridge will be broken\" is Uncertain. We cannot definitively conclude that Thor's happiness is the only factor determining whether a bridge will be broken, as the Hulk's actions also depend on his anger, which is not directly linked to Thor's happiness in the premises provided.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Thor is not happy, then no bridge will be broken\" is Uncertain."

This means that either:\n- Lithium is a rare earth element and essential for exploring future directions of electronics, or\n- Lithium is not a rare earth element and not essential for exploring future directions of electronics.\n\nThis premise indicates that lithium cannot be both a non-rare earth element and essential for electronics at the same time. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of premise 2 and premise 3\nFrom premise 2, we know that non-rare earth elements are not scarce in China. From premise 3, we know that all elements are either non-rare earth elements or rare earth elements. \n\nIf lithium is a non-rare earth element, it cannot be scarce in China. However, if it is a rare earth element, it must be scarce in China (from premise 1). \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of premise 1\nPremise 1 states that there are no elements with atomic numbers between 61-63 that are not scarce in China. If lithium has an atomic number between 61-63, it must be scarce in China. \n\nIf lithium is a non-rare earth element, it cannot be scarce in China (from premise 2), which contradicts premise 1. Therefore, lithium must be a rare earth element.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion about lithium's classification\nSince lithium must be a rare earth element, we can conclude that it is essential for exploring future directions of electronics (from premise 5). \n\nHowever, the conclusion states that lithium is used for batteries. While lithium is indeed used in batteries, the premises do not provide any direct information about lithium being used specifically for batteries. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Lithium is an element with atomic number between 61-63 and is used for batteries\" is False because while lithium is a rare earth element and essential for electronics, the premises do not confirm that it is used for batteries, nor do they confirm its atomic number range."

This means that it is not the case that Lithium is either a non-rare earth element and essential for electronics or not a non-rare earth element and not essential for electronics. This implies that Lithium must be either:\n- A rare earth element and essential for electronics, or\n- A non-rare earth element and essential for electronics.\n\nThus, we can conclude that if Lithium is not essential for electronics, it must be a rare earth element.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conclusion's antecedent\nThe conclusion states: ¬(EssentialFor(lithium, electronics) ⊕ (∃y(Between(y, num61, num63) ∧ AtomicNumber(lithium, y)))).\nThis means that if Lithium is not essential for electronics or is an element with atomic number between 61-63, we need to analyze the implications.\n\nFrom premise 1, if Lithium has an atomic number between 61-63, it must be scarce in China. However, from premise 2, if Lithium is a non-rare earth element, it cannot be scarce in China. This creates a contradiction if Lithium is a non-rare earth element with an atomic number between 61-63.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion's consequent\nThe consequent of the conclusion states: ¬(¬RareEarthElement(lithium) ∨ UsedIn(lithium, industry)). This means that if Lithium is not a non-rare earth element or is not used in industry, it must be a rare earth element and used in industry.\n\nFrom premise 4, all rare earth elements can be used in industry. Therefore, if Lithium is a rare earth element, it must be used in industry.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nSince the antecedent leads to a situation where Lithium must be a rare earth element and used in industry, the conclusion \"If Lithium is not essential for exploring future directions of electronics or an element with atomic number between 61-63, then Lithium is not a non-rare earth element or usable in industry\" is True.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion is True."

If people hire a maid or cleaning service, then they have tidy houses.\n4. If people don't care about cleanliness, then they do not prioritize cleaning.\n5.

Since Jack does not often clean his home, it follows that he does not have a tidy house.\n- From premise 2: ¬Prioritize(jack, cleaning) → ¬CleanOften(jack, home). Since Jack does not often clean his home, it follows that he does not prioritize cleaning.\n- From premise 4: ¬CareAbout(jack, cleanliness) → ¬Prioritize(jack, cleaning). Since Jack does not prioritize cleaning, it follows that he does not care about cleanliness.\n\nThus, if Case 1 is true, we conclude:\n¬Prioritize(jack, cleaning) and ¬CareAbout(jack, cleanliness).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premises 1, 2, 4, and Case 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Case 2\nIf we assume Case 2 (Jack hires a maid or cleaning service and does often clean his home), we can derive the following:\n- From premise 3: If Jack hires a maid or cleaning service, then he has a tidy house. \n- If Jack often cleans his home, we cannot directly conclude anything about his prioritization of cleaning or care about cleanliness from the premises provided.\n\nThus, in Case 2, we cannot definitively conclude anything about Jack's prioritization of cleaning or care about cleanliness.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3 and Case 2.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we see that in Case 1, we can conclude that Jack does not prioritize cleaning and does not care about cleanliness. In Case 2, we cannot conclude anything about Jack's prioritization or care. \n\nHowever, the conclusion states: ¬Prioritize(jack, cleaning) ∨ ¬CareAbout(jack, cleanliness). This conclusion is satisfied in Case 1, but we cannot definitively conclude that it is true in Case 2 since we have no information about Jack's prioritization or care in that case.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Jack is overburdened and lives in the suburbs\" is not definitively supported by the premises, leading us to conclude that it is False.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Jack is overburdened and lives in the suburbs\" is False."

Since John does not have a flexible schedule (from premise 6), he must be in the second category:\n- John must be investing in a career in which he is willing to spend the rest of his life.\n\nThis leads us to conclude that John is hardworking (from premise 4):\n- If John invests in a career, then he is hardworking.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Premise 4.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the contradiction\nIf John is hardworking, then according to premise 5, he cannot be short sighted. However, premise 6 states that John is not either hardworking or has a flexible schedule. This creates a contradiction because if John is investing in a career, he must be hardworking, which contradicts the assertion that he is not hardworking.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nSince we have established that John cannot be both hardworking and short sighted based on the premises, the conclusion \"John is short sighted\" is False.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"John is short sighted.\" is False."

This means:\n- If Room 116 is used for lectures, it must be booked during the day (from premise 1).\n- If Room 116 is used for office hours, it must be booked in the evening (from premise 5).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6, Premise 1, Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of being booked during the day and freely usable at night\nThe conclusion states that if Room 116 is both booked during the day and freely usable at night, or neither, then it is either used for office hours or for private study spots. \n\n- If Room 116 is booked during the day (from premise 1), it cannot be freely usable at night (from premise 4). Thus, the condition \"both booked during the day and freely usable at night\" cannot hold true.\n- If Room 116 is not booked during the day, it could potentially be freely usable at night, but this would contradict the conclusion that it is either used for office hours or private study spots, since premise 2 states that none of the classrooms are private study spots.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 4, Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the case where Room 116 is not used for lectures or office hours\nFrom premise 6, if Room 116 is not used for either lectures or office hours, it cannot be booked during the day or evening, and thus it cannot be freely usable at night. This means it does not satisfy the conclusion's condition.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion states that if Room 116 is either both booked during the day and freely usable at night, or neither, then it is either used for office hours or for private study spots. Given the analysis, the conclusion is True because the conditions outlined in the conclusion cannot be satisfied based on the premises provided. \n\nThus, the conclusion is consistent with the premises, confirming that Room 116 must either be used for office hours or cannot be a private study spot, as stated in the premises. \n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion is True."

However, since the premises state that all classrooms are either used for lectures or office hours, Room 116 must be used for both lectures and office hours.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of Room 116 being used for lectures and office hours\nSince Room 116 is used for office hours (from Step 1), we can apply premise 5:\n- UsedFor(116, officeHours) → BookedIn(116, evening)\n\nThis means Room 116 is booked in the evening.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion's claim\nThe conclusion states:\n¬(PrivateStudySpot(room116) ∧ FreelyUsableAtNight(room116)) → (UsedFor(room116, lecture) ∨ BookedIn(room116, evening))\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Room 116 is not a private study spot:\n- ¬PrivateStudySpot(116)\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that Room 116 is booked in the evening:\n- BookedIn(116, evening)\n\nThus, the right side of the implication (UsedFor(116, lecture) ∨ BookedIn(116, evening)) is true because Room 116 is booked in the evening.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the left side of the implication:\n- ¬(PrivateStudySpot(room116) ∧ FreelyUsableAtNight(room116))\n\nSince Room 116 is not a private study spot, the left side simplifies to:\n- ¬(False ∧ FreelyUsableAtNight(room116)) which is True.\n\nThus, we have True → True, which is valid.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Step 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Room 116 is not both a private study spot and freely usable at night, then it is either used for lectures or booked during the day\" is True. \n\nHowever, the label provided in the problem states \"False.\" This indicates a contradiction between the logical analysis and the label.

Since Erica plays a lot of chess, we can conclude that:\n- ¬BadAt(erica, chess).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 2.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Erica's interests\nFrom premise 1, we know that everyone at 'Board Game night' is either interested in puzzles or bad at chess (or both). Since we have established that Erica is not bad at chess (¬BadAt(erica, chess)), it follows that:\n- InterestedIn(erica, puzzle).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Erica's creativity\nNow we need to consider premise 5. It states that if Erica is neither bad at chess nor creative, then she is either a planner and creative or neither. Since we have established that Erica is not bad at chess, we need to analyze the implications of her being creative or not.\n\nIf we assume that Erica is creative (Creative(erica)), then the antecedent of premise 5 is false (since she is not neither bad at chess nor creative). Therefore, we cannot derive any conclusions from premise 5 regarding Erica's status as a planner or creative.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 1.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states:\n- Creative(erica) → (¬(InterestedIn(erica, puzzle) ∧ Creative(erica))).\n\nHowever, we have established that:\n- InterestedIn(erica, puzzle) is true.\n\nIf Erica is creative, then the left side of the implication is true. The right side becomes:\n- ¬(true ∧ true) = ¬true = false.\n\nThus, the implication as a whole becomes:\n- true → false, which is false.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Erica is creative, then Erica is not interested in puzzles and creative\" is False."

This means:\n- ¬Linux(pytorch)\n- ¬Software(pytorch)\n\nSince PyTorch is not a piece of software, it cannot be written with code, as stated in premise 5 (All software used in the lab computers is written with code). Therefore, we can conclude:\n- ¬WrittenWithCode(pytorch)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 8, Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the popularity of PyTorch\nSince PyTorch is not a Linux system and is not software, we cannot directly apply premise 6 (If something is convenient in the lab computer, then it is popular) because we do not know if PyTorch is convenient. However, we can analyze the implications of it being neither a Linux system nor software.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that a lab computer uses either MacOS or Linux. Since PyTorch is not a Linux system, it must be a MacOS system or something else. However, since it is not software, we cannot conclude that it is popular based on the premises provided.\n\nThus, we cannot definitively conclude that PyTorch is popular or not based on the premises. However, since it is not software, it cannot be popular as per the definitions provided in the premises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Premise 6.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion states that \"PyTorch is not popular and it is not written with code.\" We have established that PyTorch is indeed not written with code (¬WrittenWithCode(pytorch)). However, we cannot definitively conclude that PyTorch is not popular based on the premises provided, as we do not have enough information to determine its popularity.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"PyTorch is not popular and it is not written with code\" is False because while it is not written with code, we cannot confirm its popularity status.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"PyTorch is not popular and it is not written with code.\" is False."

From premise 3, since Taylor is Emily's friend, she either works in the entertainment industry or is highly acclaimed in her profession.\n\nIf Taylor works in the entertainment industry, then she cannot publish journals (from premise 1). If she is highly acclaimed, we need to consider the implications of premise 7, which states that she cannot hold both a highly acclaimed status and a tenured position.\n\nHowever, we need to determine if she can be an award-winning novelist. If she is an award-winning novelist, then according to premise 2, she must publish journals. But if she publishes journals, she cannot work in the entertainment industry (premise 1), which contradicts premise 3 if she is working in the entertainment industry.\n\nThus, if Taylor is an award-winning novelist, she must publish journals, which leads to a contradiction with her working in the entertainment industry.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nSince Taylor cannot be both an award-winning novelist and publish journals without contradicting the premises, we conclude that:\n- Taylor does not both publish journals and is an award-winning novelist.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Taylor is Emily's friend and she does not both publish journals and is an award-winning novelist\" is True.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Taylor is Emily's friend and she does not both publish journals and is an award-winning novelist\" is True."

According to premise 2, this means he receives Israeli citizenship at birth. Therefore, we can conclude that David Ha'ivri is an Israeli citizen.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze David Ha'ivri's status as a Zionist leader\nPremise 5 states that David Ha'ivri is a Zionist leader. This is a direct assertion and does not require further inference.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion regarding election to the council\nPremise 4 states that several Zionist leaders have been elected to the Shomron Regional Municipal council. However, it does not specify that David Ha'ivri is one of those leaders who have been elected. While he is a Zionist leader, we cannot conclude that he has been elected to the council based solely on the information provided. The premise only indicates that some Zionist leaders have been elected, but it does not confirm that David Ha'ivri is among them.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"David Ha'ivri has been elected to the Shomron Regional Municipal council\" is Uncertain because, while he is a Zionist leader, the premises do not provide sufficient evidence to confirm that he has been elected to the council."

According to premise 1, since it is mind-reading, it must either be brain reading or brain decoding:\n- MindReading(multivoxelPatternAnalysis) → (BrainReading(multivoxelPatternAnalysis) ∨ BrainDecoding(multivoxelPatternAnalysis))\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of brain decoding\nIf multivoxel (pattern) analysis is brain decoding, then according to premise 2, it must be extracting information from BOLD signals:\n- (MindReading(multivoxelPatternAnalysis) ∧ BrainDecoding(multivoxelPatternAnalysis)) → ExtractingFrom(multivoxelPatternAnalysis, information, bOLDSignals)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of extracting from BOLD signals\nIf multivoxel (pattern) analysis is extracting information from BOLD signals, then according to premise 3, it must use statistical pattern analysis:\n- (MindReading(multivoxelPatternAnalysis) ∧ ExtractingFrom(multivoxelPatternAnalysis, information, bOLDSignals)) → Uses(multivoxelPatternAnalysis, statisticalPatternAnalysis)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of being brain reading\nIf multivoxel (pattern) analysis is brain reading, we need to consider the implications of premise 5. If it is without statistical pattern analysis and brain reading, then it cannot be brain decoding:\n- (¬Uses(multivoxelPatternAnalysis, statisticalPatternAnalysis) ∧ BrainReading(multivoxelPatternAnalysis)) → (¬Uses(multivoxelPatternAnalysis, statisticalPatternAnalysis) ∧ ¬BrainDecoding(multivoxelPatternAnalysis))\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Step 1.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that multivoxel (pattern) analysis is either without statistical pattern analysis or writing a novel:\n- ¬Uses(multivoxelPatternAnalysis, statisticalPatternAnalysis) ∨ NovelWriting(multivoxelPatternAnalysis)\n\nFrom Step 3, we established that if multivoxel (pattern) analysis is mind-reading and extracting from BOLD signals, it must use statistical pattern analysis. Therefore, it cannot be without statistical pattern analysis if it is also brain decoding. \n\nFrom Step 4, if it is brain reading and without statistical pattern analysis, it cannot be brain decoding, which leads to a contradiction if it is also mind-reading and extracting from BOLD signals.\n\nSince multivoxel (pattern) analysis cannot be both without statistical pattern analysis and mind-reading (which implies using it), the conclusion that it is either without statistical pattern analysis or writing a novel is False.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Multivoxel (pattern) analysis is either without statistical pattern analysis or writing a novel\" is False."

From premise 2, since Product(fabricBundle) is true, we conclude ¬Perfect(fabricBundle) is also true.\n\nHowever, from premise 5, if Clothes(fabricBundle) is true, we would also conclude that Perfect(fabricBundle) is true. \n\nThis leads to a contradiction:\n- We have both Perfect(fabricBundle) and ¬Perfect(fabricBundle) being true if we assume that the fabric bundle is clothing.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince assuming that the fabric bundle is clothing leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the fabric bundle cannot be clothing.

The conclusion \"The Three-Body Problem was written by Cixin Liu\" remains Uncertain because we lack direct evidence linking the book to the author.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"The Three-Body Problem was written by Cixin Liu\" is Uncertain."

However, we only have evidence that Elephantopus scaber is a traditional medicine, not that all Elephantopus species are traditional medicines. Therefore, we cannot conclude that all members of the genus Elephantopus are traditional medicines based on the premises provided.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 4.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Elephantopus is a traditional medicine\" is Uncertain because we only know that Elephantopus scaber is a traditional medicine, and we cannot generalize this to all species within the genus Elephantopus."

Therefore, if the LaLaurie House is a creepy haunted house, it must be a mansion house, which contradicts premise 1 if it is in an urban area.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the LaLaurie House's classification.\nPremise 5 states that the LaLaurie House is either a creepy haunted house or a terrifying building on Halloween. If we assume the LaLaurie House is a creepy haunted house, then according to premise 3, it must be a mansion house. However, if it is a mansion house, it cannot be in an urban area (from premise 1). This leads to a contradiction if we assume it is a creepy haunted house.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 3, Premise 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the alternative in premise 5.\nIf the LaLaurie House is not a creepy haunted house, then it must be a terrifying building on Halloween. If it is a terrifying building on Halloween, then according to premise 4, it must also be a creepy haunted house. This again leads us back to the contradiction that it cannot be both a creepy haunted house and a mansion house in an urban area.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 4.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nSince both possibilities (that the LaLaurie House is a creepy haunted house or a terrifying building on Halloween) lead to contradictions regarding its classification as a mansion house and its location in an urban area, we cannot definitively conclude that the LaLaurie House is a terrifying building on Halloween.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"The LaLaurie House is a terrifying building on Halloween.\" is Uncertain."

According to premise 3, if a team is part of the league, it has joined the league. Therefore, we can conclude:\n- Joined(stJohnstone, scottishPremiership)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between Minsk and St Johnstone\nFrom premise 4, we know that St Johnstone and Minsk are different teams. This means that any conclusions drawn about St Johnstone do not directly apply to Minsk.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of Minsk winning against St Johnstone\nFrom premise 6, we know that Minsk won against St Johnstone. According to premise 5, since Minsk and St Johnstone are different teams, one of them must have won against the other. This confirms that Minsk won against St Johnstone, but it does not provide any information about Minsk's membership in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 6.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion about Minsk joining the league\nThe conclusion states that Minsk joined the Scottish Premiership. However, none of the premises provide information about Minsk's membership in the Scottish Premiership. The fact that Minsk won against St Johnstone does not imply that Minsk is part of the league or has joined it.\n\nPremises and steps required: None.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Minsk joined the Scottish Premiership\" is Uncertain because the premises do not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny Minsk's membership in the league."

Since the watch is a wearable item (as it is a watch), it cannot be edible. Therefore, the watch cannot be food.\n\nThus, we conclude:\n- ¬Food(watch)\n\nSince the watch cannot be food, it must be clothes based on the exclusive or from step 1.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 4, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the watch being clothes\nSince we have established that the watch must be clothes, we can use premise 5:\n- Clothes(watch) → Wearable(watch)\n\nThis means the watch is wearable.

Therefore, if the watch is a slipper, it must also be a shoe.

This premise does not directly relate to the conclusion about all humans being werewolves but reinforces the idea that becoming a werewolf involves an attack from another werewolf.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that all humans are werewolves (∀x (Human(x) → Werewolf(x))). However, based on the first premise, not all humans can turn into wolves, and thus not all humans can be classified as werewolves. Additionally, the second premise indicates that becoming a werewolf requires interaction with another werewolf, which is not guaranteed for all humans.\n\nPremises and steps required: Steps 1, 2.\n\n---\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"All humans are werewolves\" is False because not all humans can turn into wolves, and not all humans have been bitten or scratched by another werewolf. \n\nThus, the conclusion is not supported by the premises."

Since the coke is on the counter, it must be either `OrangeJuice(coke)` or `AppleJuice(coke)`.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of the coke being apple juice\nIf `AppleJuice(coke)` is true, then from premise 6, we have `Drink(coke)`. By applying premise 1, since `Drink(coke)` is true, it follows that `Edible(coke)` must also be true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 6.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of the coke not being apple juice\nIf `¬AppleJuice(coke)` is true, then from premise 7, we have `¬Edible(coke)`. This means that if the coke is not apple juice, it cannot be edible.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 7.\n\n---\n\nStep 5: Determine the sweetness of the coke\nIf `AppleJuice(coke)` is true, then from premise 5, since `OnCounter(coke)` is true, it follows that `Sweet(coke)` must also be true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 6.\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\nWe have two scenarios:\n1. If `AppleJuice(coke)` is true, then `Edible(coke)` and `Sweet(coke)` are both true.\n2. If `¬AppleJuice(coke)` is true, then `Edible(coke)` is false.\n\nHowever, since the coke must be either orange juice or apple juice (from premise 4), and if it is not apple juice, it must be orange juice. But we have no premises that state anything about the edibility of orange juice. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the coke is edible or sweet without knowing whether it is apple juice or orange juice.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"The coke is edible and sweet\" cannot be definitively determined as true or false based on the premises provided.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"The coke is edible and sweet\" is Unknown."

This means we can apply the rules regarding items on the counter.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the coke is a drink\nFrom premise 4, since everything on the counter is either orange juice or apple juice, we can conclude that the coke must be either orange juice or apple juice. \n\nIf the coke is apple juice, then from premise 6, it follows that `Drink(coke)` is true. If the coke is orange juice, then from premise 3, it is also a drink because all juices are drinks. Therefore, in either case, `Drink(coke)` is true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 3, Premise 6.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the coke is edible\nSince we have established that `Drink(coke)` is true, we can apply premise 1: `OnCounter(coke) ∧ Drink(coke) → Edible(coke)`. Since `OnCounter(coke)` is true, and `Drink(coke)` is true, it follows that `Edible(coke)` must also be true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion regarding sweetness\nNow we need to check if the coke is sweet. If the coke is apple juice, then from premise 5, `Sweet(coke)` is true. If the coke is orange juice, we have no information about its sweetness from the premises. \n\nHowever, we know that if the coke is not apple juice, then from premise 7, `¬AppleJuice(coke) → ¬Edible(coke)`. Since we have already established that `Edible(coke)` is true, it follows that `AppleJuice(coke)` must be true. Therefore, the coke must be apple juice, which means `Sweet(coke)` is also true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5, Premise 7, Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion states that \"The coke is not edible and sweet,\" which translates to `¬(Edible(coke) ∧ Sweet(coke))`. However, we have established that `Edible(coke)` is true and `Sweet(coke)` is also true. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"The coke is not edible and sweet\" is False."

Therefore, we can apply the premises that pertain to people in Franny's family to Damon.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Drinking Habits\nFrom premise 1, we know that people in Franny's family drink kombucha every day or drink Coca-Cola or a Pepsi product. This means that Damon either drinks kombucha or one of the other beverages.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Implications of Drinking Coca-Cola or Pepsi\nIf Damon drinks Coca-Cola or a Pepsi product (from premise 1), then by premise 2, he would have grown up with extremely busy parents who did not have time to pack him lunch. This leads to premise 3, which states that he would have to visit the dentist frequently.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Erratic Eating Habits\nIf Damon grew up with busy parents (from premise 2), then by premise 4, he would have erratic and diverse eating habits. This leads to premise 5, which states that he would not have consistent everyday routines and would not like sticking to a solid schedule.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\nStep 5: Analyze Damon's Options\nFrom premise 7, we know that Damon either grew up with busy parents and has consistent routines or he did neither. If he did grow up with busy parents, he cannot have consistent routines (from premise 5). Therefore, the only option left is that he did neither.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 7.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion Analysis\nIf Damon did neither grow up with busy parents nor drink kombucha, then he would not have to visit the dentist frequently (from premise 3) and would not drink Coca-Cola or Pepsi products. Thus, the conclusion holds true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If Damon is in Franny's family and he either both grew up with extremely busy parents who did not have time to pack his lunch and drink kombucha every day or neither grew up with extremely busy parents who did not have time to pack his lunch nor drink kombucha every day, then Damon neither visits the dentist frequently nor drinks Coca-Cola or Pepsi products.\" is True."

Therefore, we can derive two cases:\n1. If Cold(arthritis) is true, then Have(arthritis, mutation) is also true.\n2. If Cold(arthritis) is false, then Have(arthritis, mutation) is also false.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 5.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of arthritis being a cancer\nIf arthritis is a cancer, then by premise 1 (∀x (Cancer(x) → Have(x, mutation))), it must have mutations. However, if it has mutations, then by premise 2 (∀x (Have(x, mutation) → ¬CanBeTreatedAtHome(x))), it cannot be treated at home. \n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that if arthritis is not colorectal cancer (¬ColorectalCancer(arthritis)), then arthritis has mutations (Have(arthritis, mutation)). \n\n- If arthritis is not colorectal cancer, we cannot directly conclude that it has mutations. The premises do not provide a direct link between being a non-colorectal cancer and having mutations. \n- If arthritis is a cold, it can be treated at home, which contradicts the idea that it has mutations (as mutations cannot be treated at home). \n- If arthritis is neither a cold nor has mutations, then the conclusion does not hold.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"if arthritis is not colorectal cancer, then arthritis has mutations\" is not supported by the premises.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 1, Step 2.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"If arthritis is not colorectal cancer, then arthritis has mutations\" is False."

Therefore, he is not invited to join the club (from premise 3), which means he is not provided with delicious meals (from premise 5).\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 3, Premise 5.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the implications of not being provided with delicious meals\nSince James is not provided with delicious meals, he cannot be invited to take a photo with the audience (from premise 7).

This means it satisfies the conditions of being quiet and good at sea, as stated in premise 4. Therefore, we can conclude:\n- Quiet(TS Leda) ∧ GoodAt(TS Leda, sea)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Premise 4.\n\nStep 2: Relate quietness and good performance at sea to powerful steam turbine engines\nFrom premise 5, we know that there exist ships that are quiet and good at sea and have powerful steam turbine engines. Since TS Leda is a good passenger and cargo vessel, it is reasonable to consider that it could be one of those ships. However, we do not have a direct link that states TS Leda specifically has powerful steam turbine engines.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 4, Premise 5.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the stabilizers and their implications\nFrom premise 2, we know that TS Leda was built with stabilizers. According to premise 3, stabilizers are mechanical devices found only on ships with powerful steam turbine engines. Therefore, since TS Leda has stabilizers, it must also have powerful steam turbine engines.\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 2, Premise 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nSince we have established that TS Leda has powerful steam turbine engines based on the premises, the conclusion \"TS Leda had powerful steam turbine engines\" is True.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"TS Leda had powerful steam turbine engines.\" is True."

ConvictedCriminal(garry) ∧ ¬(FoundGuilty(garry) ∨ SentencedToPunishment(garry))\n\nConclusion:\nGarry is not both innocent and someone who did not commit a crime.\nConclusion-FOL:\n¬(Innocent(garry) ∧ ¬CommitCrime(garry))\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Analyze Garry's status as a convicted criminal\nFrom premise 6, we know that Garry is a convicted criminal and that he is neither found guilty nor sentenced to punishment. This means:\n- ¬FoundGuilty(garry)\n- ¬SentencedToPunishment(garry)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 6.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the implications of Garry's status\nFrom premise 3, we have:\n- All convicted criminals are either truly guilty or found guilty. Since Garry is not found guilty (¬FoundGuilty(garry)), it follows that he must be truly guilty:\n- TrulyGuilty(garry)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 3, Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications of being truly guilty\nIf Garry is truly guilty, then he cannot be innocent. According to premise 1, if a convicted criminal is innocent, they are not truly guilty. Since Garry is truly guilty, it follows that he cannot be innocent:\n- ¬Innocent(garry)\n\nPremises and steps required: Premise 1, Step 2.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that Garry is not both innocent and someone who did not commit a crime:\n¬(Innocent(garry) ∧ ¬CommitCrime(garry))\n\nSince we have established that Garry is truly guilty (and thus not innocent), the statement Innocent(garry) is false. Therefore, the conjunction Innocent(garry) ∧ ¬CommitCrime(garry) must also be false, making the conclusion true.\n\nPremises and steps required: Step 3.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"Garry is not both innocent and someone who did not commit a crime\" is True."
